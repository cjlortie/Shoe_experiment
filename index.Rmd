## Colour perception in humans  
Hypothesis  
People perceive colours differently, and this perception is fluent not fixed.  

Predictions  
1. An object with ambiguous colours can be perceived as different palettes by different people.  
2. Hemisphere dominance or handedness influences colour perception.  
3. Tasks can switch colour perception.  

#### Data
```{r data}
library(tidyverse)
library(gsheet)
data <- gsheet2tbl('docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u677DhVI3dkR3fSNorPrz9NtrD_qnqT5GGnyLnO2deA') %>% 
  select(2:4) %>% 
  rename(colour = 1, switch = 2, handedness = 3) %>% 
  as_tibble()

write_csv(data, "data/data.csv")

```
